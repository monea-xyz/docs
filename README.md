# ðŸ§± Welcome

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE:** The content in these docs is a _bit_ outdated. We have an updated "blurb" description of what we're building at Monea (as of July 17th, 2024). [Please check out our website](https://monea.xyz) in the meantime. I swear I'll update these docs soon :) â€“ Jacob D. Castro, CEO

Thanks for checking out the **absolute earliest version** of our docs!

We're building the unopinionated platform Rollup Legos ðŸ§±. We're just getting started and we're excited to announce more real soon.

We currently operate a closed Telegram group chat for early access members. If you'd like to join it, please reach out at any of the below links and we'll add you.

For any other questions, comments, or collabs, you can reach me wherever! â€“Â Jacob D. Castro, CEO
