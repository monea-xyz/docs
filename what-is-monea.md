# What is Monea?

{% hint style="info" %}
Yeah, so we no longer identify as a RaaS. You found these docs so early, that we're still iterating on our communication. But the "Roadmap" section is actually fairly accurate! We'll be announcing more soon. :) â€“ Jacob D. Castro, CEO (July 17th, 2024)

~~Monea is an open Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform designed to offer ultimate flexibility for cross-chain app developers and chain operator teams. With the Monea Engine, you can easily experiment with every possible stack, enabling the creation of tailored solutions that fit you and your users' unique needs. We call this concept "rollup legos," allowing you to build and innovate modularly without restrictions.~~

~~While other RaaS platforms may struggle with issues like vendor lock-in and limited modularity, Monea is unopinionated, modular. Whether teams prioritize pure decentralization or seek a balance between decentralization and performance, Monea meets every team where they're at, supporting a variety of Layer 2 philosophies.~~

## Roadmap

Monea not only provides unparalleled flexibility but also includes advanced features such as based sequencing and preconfirmations. Looking ahead, our roadmap aims to support all rollup frameworks, data availability layers, and sequencers, ensuring comprehensive compatibility and flexibility for all users.

While we remain an unopinionated platform, we are especially prioritizing based sequencing and preconfirmations. We believe that based sequencing, based rollups, and preconfirmations will be a significant ecosystem unlock for user experience. By focusing on these areas, we aim to make it easier for your team to stay ahead in the fast-moving world of rollup R\&D and effortlessly adapt to future paradigms.
