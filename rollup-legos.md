# Rollup Legos

Monea introduces the innovative concept of "rollup legos," allowing developers to piece together various components to create customized solutions. This modularity lets developers mix and match elements like rollup frameworks, data availability layers, and sequencers. Using the Monea Engine, they access a versatile platform that supports the full spectrum of Layer 2 technologies. This is crucial in an environment where developers need a proof of concept platform. They need to prove concepts right, prove them wrong, and prove them quickly. With rollup legos, Monea enables rapid experimentation and iteration, empowering developers to innovate without constraints.

The Monea Engine and rollup legos significantly enhance developers’ ability to swiftly test and validate ideas. By prioritizing advanced features like based sequencing and preconfirmations, Monea supports a wide array of configurations while focusing on key user experience improvements. This allows developers to concentrate on creating and refining applications. Whether aiming for pure decentralization or a balanced approach, Monea’s modular and unopinionated platform ensures developers have the tools they need to stay ahead in the dynamic world of rollup R\&D.
